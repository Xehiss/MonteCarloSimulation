# Monte Carlo Simulation in Finance

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Monte Carlo Simulations for pricing barrier options in the Black-Scholes model, focusing on down-and-in and up-and-in put options. Implemented in Vlang.

## Features
- Pricing of down-and-in and up-and-in put options.
- Custom random number generator module.
- Sobol sequences for quasi-random number generation.
- Monte Carlo simulation for barrier option pricing.

## Requirements
- Vlang programming environment.
- Knowledge of financial derivatives and Black-Scholes model.

## Usage
1. Set parameters (stock price, volatility, etc.).
2. Choose barrier option type.
3. Run simulation.
